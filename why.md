# Why?

## Why not use slices for slugs in `Fragment`s?
Slices require lifetimes

## Why not give `Fragment`s lifetimes?
Because `Fragment` trait can't be serialized with lifetimes

## Why can't the traits be serialized with lifetimes?
Because trait serialization is only supported with `typetag`
and `typetag` can't just create lifetimes at runtime.

## Why is `Fragment` a trait?
It is easier to reason with fragment being a trait.
Also if slugs were slices it would require that the Fragment
object has a lifetime.
Being that the fragment would then be generated by the `Node`
in `get_nodes` there is the potential for the fragment to need
to have multiple conflicting lifetimes.
This actually occurred with `NativeFragment` and `NativeNode`

## Why not use arrays for slugs in `Fragment`?
Because copying short strings into bytearrays is surprisingly
complicated
